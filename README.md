# Introduction
The ABM is a kind of useful model for studying behaviour and emergency in complex systems.
The model uses 'agent' to represent doing various things in simulation steps.
What the agents do will in some ways change their characteristics, the characteristics of other agents, and the spatial 'environment' in which they are located and which is represented as a different kind of entity.

# abm1 & abm2
In these two parts, the main mission are:
1. create an agent list to represent a series of [x, y] coordinates.
2. using simple loops and plotting to reveal locations of points that situate in the agent.

# abm3
1. Calculate the maximum distance between two random points in the agent by defining functions (max_distance)
2. Plotting time taken to calculate maximum distance for different numbers of agents
3. Create a new loop for moving agents

# abm4
This part aims at using class in Python. Create methods in the new class like __init__() in agentframework.py.
Connect agentframework.py with model.py by using import.
Compared with former part result, the new plot is the same as it.
